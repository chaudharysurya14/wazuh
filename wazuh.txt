#WAZUH#
-->Wazuh is an open-source security information and event management (SIEM) tool used for threat detection, integrity monitoring, vulnerability detection, and response. It provides a comprehensive set of security information and event management capabilities for organizations to enhance their cybersecurity posture. Wazuh is designed to be scalable, extensible, and customizable to meet the diverse security needs of different environments.

Key features and components of Wazuh include:

1. Log Analysis and Correlation:
Wazuh collects and analyzes log data from various sources within an environment, including operating systems, applications, network devices, and more. It uses correlation rules to identify patterns and potential security threats by combining and analyzing log events.

2. Intrusion Detection System (IDS):
Wazuh includes an intrusion detection system that monitors network traffic and system logs for signs of suspicious or malicious activity. It can detect and alert on potential security incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, and other security threats.

3. Vulnerability Detection:
Wazuh can perform vulnerability scanning to identify potential security weaknesses in the environment. It integrates with vulnerability databases and provides alerts when it detects systems with known vulnerabilities.

4. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):
Wazuh monitors changes to critical system files and configurations to detect unauthorized modifications. This helps in identifying potential security breaches or compromises.

5. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):
Wazuh acts as a SIEM solution by collecting, normalizing, and analyzing security-related data. It provides dashboards, visualizations, and reports to help security analysts gain insights into the security status of their environment.

6. Threat Intelligence Integration:
Wazuh can be integrated with threat intelligence feeds to enhance its ability to identify and respond to emerging threats. This integration allows organizations to stay informed about the latest threat intelligence information.

7. Scalability and Extensibility:
Wazuh is designed to scale to large environments, making it suitable for both small and enterprise-level deployments. It supports distributed architectures, allowing for scalability and resilience. Additionally, Wazuh is extensible through plugins and custom rules to adapt to specific security requirements.

8. Active Responses:
Wazuh supports active responses, enabling automated actions in response to security events. For example, it can block an IP address or execute a custom script based on defined rules.

=> Wazuh is often used in conjunction with other security tools and solutions to provide a comprehensive security monitoring and response platform. It is commonly deployed in environments where real-time threat detection, incident response, and compliance monitoring are crucial aspects of the cybersecurity strategy.
